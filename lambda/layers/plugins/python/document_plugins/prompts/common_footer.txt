CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (ALL DOCUMENT TYPES):

1. Your response must be ONLY the JSON object -- no explanations, no preamble, no markdown code blocks.
2. Start your response with {{ and end with }}.
3. Do NOT hallucinate or infer values not explicitly present in the extracted text.
4. Use null for any field where the value cannot be determined from the source data.
5. Do NOT use empty strings "" -- use null instead.
6. Convert ALL percentage values to decimal format (e.g., 8.5% -> 0.085).
7. Convert ALL currency amounts to plain numbers without symbols (e.g., $1,500,000 -> 1500000).
8. Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
9. Preserve exact names, addresses, and identifiers as they appear in the source.
10. If a field appears multiple times with different values, use the most recent or most authoritative instance and note the discrepancy in validationNotes.
11. For arrays (tiers, lenders, owners, etc.), include EVERY entry from the source -- do NOT truncate, summarize, or limit the count.
12. Include validation notes for any uncertain extractions, format inconsistencies, or cross-reference mismatches.
13. Track which section/page each critical value was extracted from in the audit trail.
14. Be conservative -- better to return null than incorrect data.
